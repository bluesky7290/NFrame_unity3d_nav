build

    Contains Visual Studio projects and build related source files for active 
    projects.

doc

    Documentation project and source files.

src

    Source for active projects.

    The source directory layout is a bit odd.  Most C# source is located
    under  /src/main/Assets/CAI.  This layout mimics the layout within
    a Unity project.  It is structured in this way to support easy source
    deployment to non-Windows Unity projects which can't use the pre-compiled
    libraries.

>> Unity Notes <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Libraries and namespaces containing 'u3d' depend on Unity Pro 
(http://unity3d.com/). The free version of unity is not supported.

The Visual Studio projects were created on Windows 64-bit, so the Unity DLL 
reference will be broken on 32-bit Windows.

For Unity 3.x, the normal location of the DLL for both operating systems is 
as follows:

Windows 32-bit: C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed
Windows 64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\
